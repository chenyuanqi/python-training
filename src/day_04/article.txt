Hi Lavender. This is quite a difficult question but let me try to explain. The sentence is trying to emphasise the verb 'prepare'. (In comparison, Preparing anti-bullying lessons is another thing teachers could do - 'preparing' is less emphasised because it's at the beginning of the sentence.)
There are many sentence beginnings like this.
Another thing teachers could do is ...
Something teachers could do is ...
What teachers could do is ...
The best thing teachers can do is ...
After all these, put the verb we want to emphasise. It can be with 'to' or without it.
The best thing teachers can do is (to) prepare anti-bullying lessons.
We can also put a noun there instead of the verb. That's why it's also ok to say the sentence below (because the -ing form functions as a noun).
The best thing teachers can do is preparing anti-bullying lessons.
Does that make sense? :)
